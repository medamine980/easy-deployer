# Easy-Deployer:
Easy-deployer is used to simplify and speed up the deployment process.

## Supported platforms to deploy to:
- Github
- ~~Heroku~~ (Not supported since they stopped offering the free plan)

## OS Support:
Currently windows is the only supported os.

## Setup
With python (python >= 3.7):
```shell
    pip install easy-deployer
    # or
    python -m pip install easy-deployer
```
Without python: you can download the [executable binary][bin/exe]


## How to use
The easiest way is to just execute the easy-deployer executable and then you're gonna be prompted to enter some information such as: where do you want deploy it? what type of commande would you like to choose etc...
Otherwise you can use the option --help for more info.
